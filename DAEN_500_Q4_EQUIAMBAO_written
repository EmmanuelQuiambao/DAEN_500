What is a component – Provide a description (5 points)
  
  A component is a combination of predictor variables.  Typically a combination of predictor variables that are highly 
  correlated.


Principal Component Analysis – Provide a description.(5 points)
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the process of reducing variables into components. This helps to make analysis 
  simpler for the data set. in PCA, the representation of the data is rotated in the direction of the new principal 
  components.  The process of PCA first involves creating a correlation matrix of each predicted variable.  Next, 
  Eigenvectors must be found and their corresponding eigenvalues. An eigenvector is a vector that results in the scalar
  multiple of the correlation matrix.  Once eigenvectors are found they must be ranked by eigenalue which is the change
  in vector length after the vector is multiplied by the eigenvector.  The highest eigenvector is use for the first principal
  component and the second highest for the next and so on.  The principal component Z is calculated by multiplying each 
  predictor variable by their corresponding value in the eigenvector.  Once all principal components have been calcualted,
  they can be evaluated to see which principal components cause the highest variability.  the
