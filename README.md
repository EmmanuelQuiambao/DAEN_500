5A- Multiple Linear Regression is use to find if there is linear relationship between a quantitative response variable and one or more predictor variables.  Logistic Regression does not involve a qantitative response variable, rather a binary response variable.  In other words, Logistic regression is used when the response variable only has two possible outcomes (e.g., true/false).  

In linear regression you trying to find if out if linear relationship exists to see if you can predict the effect that a change in the predictor variable will have on the change in the response variable. Linear regression relies on assumptions that mean of residuals is approximately 0, variance of residuals is constant, errors are independent, and errors are normally distributed. In my first example in 5B, I use NBA data to see if linear relation exists see if a player's points per game average and salary has a correlation to their winning percentage.  Scatter plots are used to see if there might be a linear relationship between winning percentage and both salary and points per game. The summary run on Model 1 shows the coefficients (slopes) for points and salary, .0039 and .002659.  The overall P-value for th F-statistic of 0.01092 suggests that the regression model should be considered, but the individual p-values for each co-efficient suggest that the coefficients for points per game and salary are not statistically significant.  The residual scatter plot checks that the mean of zerp and constant variance assumptions are true.  The normality plot is used to check independence.
