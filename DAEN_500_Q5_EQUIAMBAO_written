5A- Multiple Linear Regression is use to find if there is linear relationship between a quantitative response variable and one or more predictor variables.  
Logistic Regression does not involve a qantitative response variable, rather a binary response variable.  In other words, Logistic regression is used when the 
response variable only has two possible outcomes (e.g., true/false).  

In linear regression you trying to find if out if linear relationship exists to see if you can predict the effect that a change in the predictor variable will 
have on the change in the response variable. Linear regression relies on assumptions that mean of residuals is approximately 0, variance of residuals is constant, 
errors are independent, and errors are normally distributed. In my first example in 5B, I use NBA data to see if linear relation exists see if a player's points 
per game average and salary has a correlation to their winning percentage.  Scatter plots are used to see if there might be a linear relationship between winning 
percentage and both salary and points per game. The summary run on Model 1 shows the coefficients (slopes) for points and salary, .0039 and .002659.  The overall 
P-value for th F-statistic of 0.01092 suggests that the regression model should be considered, but the individual p-values for each co-efficient suggest that the 
coefficients for points per game and salary are not statistically significant.  The residual scatter plot checks that the mean of zerp and constant variance 
assumptions are true.  The normality plot is used to check independence. 

In a logistic regressionmodel you are trying to find out if the predictor variables can be used to find the probablity that response variable is trure or false. 
in my example I use data from WHO to see if age can be used to predict whether someone has had a stroke or not.  
The first scatter plot and the resulting coefficient for age (.074727) suggest that the probability of having a stroke increases with age.  
The coefficent showed statistical significant. The peasrson residual plot is assesses the model fit and evaluates the residuals created by the differences 
between actual binary responses and the estimated probabilities.
